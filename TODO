PROBLEM: 

the page explode because to many stations data to load:
- image url
- streaming url 

SOLUTION:

!! DONE !! home page : list of countries - click action -> stations (of that country) page

!! TO DO !!
stations page: do group by tags?? (MAYBE)
DONE ->  Load only the image and the title of them, then...
	when user click on one station of interest it will load the player
	for listening to live radio!


-> tags page: Too many of them... maybe order them by country might be the best idea...






LATER STUFF 
-> create a function to close the audio player


-> check if the function FetchStationsDetailed return only the working stations 
if set the bool to true on the hide
