PROBLEM: 

the page explode because to many stations data to load:
- image url
- streaming url 

SOLUTIONS:
opt1 -> Create an algorithm to load only 10 or 20 stations at a time. ex: "/countries/?country={country}/?page=1"
        - cut the array of stations in multiple ones (maybe)




opt2 -> 


!!!!

code to keep for future functions: 

var virginRadio Station
for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
	if strings.Contains(s[i].Name, "Virgin") {
 		virginRadio = s[i]
 	}
}
log.Print("virgin radio -> ", virginRadio)
