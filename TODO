PROBLEM: 

the page explode because to many stations data to load:
- image url
- streaming url 

SOLUTIONS:
opt1 -> Create an algorithm to load only 10 or 20 stations at a time. ex: "/countries/?country={country}/?page=1"
        - cut the array of stations in multiple ones (maybe)




opt2 -> Change the structure of the project:
	home page : Selecting the country of interest... click on it!
		the stations page return all the station names and the link to the specific url... click on one of it!
			specific station, (ex. country: italy, station: VirginRadio) so at the page VirginRadio page
			u can listen to the music of the selected station


!!!!

code to keep for future functions: 

var virginRadio Station
for i := 0; i < len(s); i++ {
	if strings.Contains(s[i].Name, "Virgin") {
 		virginRadio = s[i]
 	}
}
log.Print("virgin radio -> ", virginRadio)
